## Description
The goal with this was to:
- Make a hotel booking website with contact and being able to book hotels.
- Successfully login using jwt tokens from a strapi user which redirects you to an admin page where only authorized users can do things.
- Create new establishments on the Admin page.
- List the messages and bookings made from customers.
- Search filter with dropdown for the hotels.

Hotel booking website made with React and Sass. This was my first big react project, it has a few missing features since the main goal was to meet the criteria for the brief.
I used strapi to make my API data and deployed in on Heroku.

## Built with
